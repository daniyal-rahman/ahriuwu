# STATUS (rewrite in place; last edit 2026-09-25 17:45 UTC, Claude)

**Goal now:** a randomly initialised PPO policy that scores >30 CS in a
10-minute mirror trial on the C# server, evaluated frozen over seeds. JAX
runs are paused until that gate is met.

**Running:** E06 only (resumed 06:48 UTC from update 260, job 1453, evaluator
re-armed). Frozen u320: 5.3 / 6.0 CS (untrained level; 0.8M decisions).
Throughput 12 s/update = 213 dec/s with the node to itself; the GRU's
BPTT update (128-step scan x 16 minibatch-epochs) is ~2/3 of that and is
the next thing to optimise if E06 shows learning. The desktop was on Windows 04:11-06:37 UTC, which cancelled E04 and E06. Dani's decision (04:55 UTC): continue ONLY the GRU arm
with published defaults (E06). E04 stays stopped (frozen 18.8/24.5 at u2020,
train chunks 27-31 at u3070; its checkpoints remain). 

**Done today:** Codex's uncommitted server-first work committed (`35210dc`);
collector 3-5x faster; mirror mode, resume, frozen eval; lr 1e-5 identified as
the dead learner; REW-11 (shaping paid for sitting in base) and PPO-15
(entropy favoured coordinate buttons) found and fixed; rank loop no longer
aborts; red setup route legged in both engines; legacy code moved to
`legacy/`; CODEMAP, EXPERIMENTS, patch and probe indexes written.

**Screen-click verified on the live server (probe 1, `lanerl_jax/probes/screen_click_probe.py`):**
a click cell is 30 x 36 world units at screen centre (smaller than a minion);
attack-move clicks on a minion acquired it; ground clicks land within
quantisation (7-22 u) and the champion arrives within 1 u. Probe 2
(`screen_click_probe2.py`): right-click and attack-move on a minion set the
server target for BLUE and RED, raw and through the grid + lane frame, at
65-685 u. Probe 1's right-click misses were at 600-1000 u where cell
quantisation exceeds the minion's collision radius; attack-move auto-acquire
covers that range. Verdict: the click interface is implemented correctly.

**First frozen evaluation (update 760, 5 mirror episodes, 20:28 UTC):** blue
mean 19.4 CS (11-27), red mean 16.0 (11-29), 0-2 deaths each. Below the 30
gate. Update 1080: blue 14.2 (5-22), red 21.0. Train CS has been FLAT at
16-18 per episode since about update 500: the run has plateaued at half the
gate. Diagnosis: the button mix swings between strategies (E-spin 81% at u460,
attack-move 38% at u820, Q 63% at u1126) with KL ~1e-2 per update: the
policy wanders rather than converges. Dani's replay review found the real defects: 46-54% of movement clicks land on
unwalkable ground (the server then walks straight into the wall, hence the
edge-hugging), and the +0.005*xp term paid 1.11x the CS term, teaching both
champions to camp the brush beside the wave. Fixed on the SERVER (`screen-click-v3`, build `ClickV3`, PATH-011): unwalkable
click targets resolve to the closest reachable point, as the real client does.
XP is enemy-only on the server (checked, SIDE-001) and stays, at weight 0.002
(was 0.005, which out-paid CS).
E03 (lr test) stopped; E04 branches E01's state at update 1520 on ClickV3 with
XP 0.002 at the same lr. FIRST SIGNAL (2026-09-26 00:40 UTC): E04's first 12
training episodes average 28.1 CS (30-42 in eight of them) against E01's
17-21 at the same point: the wall-click fix is the biggest single gain so far.
Frozen eval at E04 update 1820 pending. E01 (control, DeadProbe) still running.

E05 launched 01:20 UTC (see Running).

**Next:**
1. Periodic frozen evaluation every ~300 updates (`ops/periodic_eval.sh`, results in `runs/EVAL/summary.jsonl`).
3. Multi-process collector (`--workers N`, `MultiProcessCollector`) is
   implemented and smoke-tested: 12 envs mirror, workers=1 vs 3 gave the same
   ~770 decisions/s on 6 cores while E01 held 8 cores -- the desktop is
   SERVER-CPU-bound at ~14 servers, not Python-bound any more. More throughput
   needs more cores (or fewer ticks per decision), not more workers.
4. If E01 plateaus below 30: run seeds 1-2 (`SEED=1 experiments/E01_mirror_wave.sh`).

**Open bugs / unknowns:** attack completion is not attributed (Codex saw zero
logged basic-attack completions in a 20-CS episode); `trainer.py` still has
the PPO-15 bias; ENT-02 vs AA-007 (retarget mid-windup) unmeasured.

**Approved and done 2026-09-25:** branches `bronze`, `eval-results-jan12`,
`report/2026-09-02`, `lane-rl/spike`, `t3code/4b6bc7fc` and the agent
worktree branch deleted (tags `archive/*` pushed to origin); the eight
frozen `ahriuwu-*-20260925` worktrees and `_deprecated/ahriuwu-lanerl`
removed; server builds `HudProbe`, `ScreenClick` deleted and `Release`
replaced by a symlink to `DeadProbe`. Remaining branches: `main`,
`lane-rl/jax` (active), `t3code/9283ee84` (another T3 thread's worktree).

Rules: whoever starts or stops a run edits this file in the same commit.
History lives in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` and `docs/JAX_FIDELITY_LEDGER.md`.
